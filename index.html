    <p> In recent years, I've mined Tyler Cowen's annual retrospective for interesting references or overlooked episodes. 
        This year, mostly for fun and partially to get a bit of calibration on aesthetic predispositions, I asked the Agents to do it.
    </p>
    <p>Four AI coding agents were given the prompt below. Here are their one-shot solutions:</p>

    <p class="links">
        <a href="./2025-12-28-cowen-review-claude/">Claude Code (Opus 4.5)</a> ·
        <a href="./2025-12-28-cowen-review-codex/">GPT Codex (5.2 High)</a> ·
        <a href="./2025-12-28-cowen-review-gemini/">Gemini 3 Auto</a> ·
        <a href="./2025-12-28-cowen-review-grok/">Grok 4.1 Thinking</a>
    </p>

    <div class="prompt">
        I'd like to make a static web page I can host on github that focuses on Tyler Cowen's 2025 year in review podcast. The full transcript is here: https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/conversations-with-tyler-2025-retrospective/<br><br>
        I'd like to focus on his episodes that he praised or endorsed the most, with his comments or reason why.<br><br>
        I'd also like to highlight references to books or articles of note - again, only items that get some meaningful endorsement and that endorsement "why" should be clear.<br><br>
        I'd like this to be visually scannable as a page, with clear organization of topics (podcasts vs books vs other endorsements) and visually rich but sleek in overall design.
    </div>
